# Privacy Policy

Last updated: March 2024

## Overview

Workspace Tab Manager is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains our data collection and usage practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

The extension operates entirely locally within your browser and:
- Does not track your browsing activity
- Does not collect personal information
- Does not use analytics or tracking tools
- Does not store data outside your browser
- Does not communicate with external servers

## Local Storage Usage

The only data stored is:
- Your extension preferences (locally in browser storage)
- Temporary tab movement history for undo/redo functionality consisting only of tab IDs (cleared when browser closes)
- The names of some open tabs are used to display in the UI, but these names are not stored.

This data never leaves your browser and is only used to provide the extension's core functionality.

## Permissions

The extension requires only the minimum permissions needed for tab/window management:
- `tabs` - To move tabs between windows
- `storage` - To save your preferences locally
- `windows` - To manage window operations

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party services or integrate with external APIs.

## Updates to This Policy

We will update this privacy policy as needed. Major changes will be announced through the extension's release notes.

## Contact

## Additional Rights

- Disable or uninstall the extension at any time
- Clear local storage through your browser settings
