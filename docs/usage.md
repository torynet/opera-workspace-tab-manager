## Basic Usage

1. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar (top right)

??? question "Can't find the icon?"
    If you don't see the extension icon in Opera:

    - Click the "Extensions" cube :material-cube-outline: icon in the top right corner of the browser

    - Find ![Workspace Tab Manager Icon](icons/icon16.png) "Workspace Tab Manager" in the dropdown list

    - Click the pin :octicons-pin-16: icon next to it, to keep it visible in your toolbar

1. Select your desired destination window from the list

3. All tabs from your current window will move to the selected window

The popup shows:

- Each window with its workspace name and tab count
- Preview of tab names on hover
- "New Window" option in green
- Undo / Redo button (available when applicable)

## Features

### Window Movement

- Move all tabs to an existing window
- Create a new window with all current tabs
- Preview destination window tab names by hovering

### Speed Dial Handling

- Option to utilize Speed Dial tabs as a mechanism by which to preserve the workspace within the window, so that it doesn't close when all the tabs move to another window
- Configure Speed Dial behavior in extension options

### Undo/Redo

- Single-click undo of last move
- Restore previous window state

## Tips

### Workspace Management

- Use for organizing tabs across monitors
- Combine or split workspaces easily
- Utilize Speed Dial tabs for workspace preservation, but avoid moving, duplicating or proliferating them

### Common Use Cases

1. Moving workspace to different monitor
2. Combining multiple workspaces
3. Be able to more effectively use workspaces, because they are not stuck in the window they are in unless you round them up and mouse drag them around

> **Note**: All of these behaviors can be customized in the [Configuration Guide](config.md), including Speed Dial handling, undo timeout, and window focus behavior.
