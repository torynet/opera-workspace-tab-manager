# Workspace Tab Manager Documentation

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/torynet/opera-workspace-tab-manager?label=version)](https://github.com/torynet/opera-workspace-tab-manager/releases)

This extension makes Opera's workspace feature more powerful by letting you easily move workspace tabs between windows. While Opera's workspaces are great for organizing tabs by topic, they can get stuck in specific windows. This extension solves that by letting you:

- Move an entire workspace to a different monitor with two clicks
- Combine multiple workspaces into one window
- More easily use workspaces across different screens
- Preserve workspace identity when moving tabs

Instead of having to manually drag individual tabs around, you can move all tabs from one window to another instantly. This makes workspaces more flexible and practical, especially when working across multiple monitors or reorganizing your workflow.
